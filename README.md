# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
A speech emotion recognition dataset for the English language

Emotions are complex multidimensional concepts, we have built a model to classify the emotion of that given a short snippet of audio containing a spoken sentence in English predicts whether the emotion of the voice is happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgusted, surprised, and neutral. This study aims to create and evaluate two classifiers, one SVM classifier and one linear Neural Network to predict the sentiment of audio
using the extracted features.
The proposed system is tested on a dataset of almost 10k samples and is able to classify up to 62.7% of voices accurately(using F1 Score as evaluation method)
